# How to use
-Upon Startup you'll be prompted to input a file path and an output directory.

# Side Notes
I Didn't have much free time to complete this, and wasted a bunch of time trying to solve the main algorithm without looking it up and in a way that is more efficient than using recursion (Didn't work out) but this should give you a general Idea of how I would try to get this done. It may be a bit much, maybe even a bit broken, but I treated it as though it were something we'd continue supporting.
